# Current Projects
[CloudZack](https://cloudzack.com) and [StitchJournal](https://stitchjournal.com) are my two main projects currently. I also recently started playing around with OpenAI and am playing around with the capabilities with my project [August](https://github.com/zackrylangford/openai-chatgpt)

## [CloudZack](https://cloudzack.com)
I started CloudZack in 2022 with the goal of helping people use the power of the cloud to improve their lives and businesses.

## [StitchJournal](https://stitchjournal.com)
StitchJournal is a web application built on Django and hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It is a simple application designed to help crochet pattern designers organize and publish their crochet patterns. I am building this in collaboration with [Yarn and Chai](https://yarnandchai.com)

## [August](https://github.com/zackrylangford/openai-chatgpt)

My attempt at creating a cool ChatGPT application. I named the AI "August" so it felt a little more personal.
