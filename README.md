# Current Projects
[CloudZack AI Tools](https://ai.cloudzack.com) and [StitchJournal](https://stitchjournal.com) are my two main projects currently. [August](https://github.com/zackrylangford/openai-august) is where I work on developing and playing around with AI language models. I also reflect on life, coding, and pursuing a career in tech at my blog [blog.zackrylangford](https://blog.zackrylangford.com)

## [CloudZack](https://cloudzack.com)
With the goal of empowering users to use cloud technology to its fullest potential, CloudZack was born in 2022. CloudZack has recently lauched the StitchJournal application - an innovative app that makes it easy for users to track their progress on stitching projects. With other innovative products on the horizon, we're excited to see what the future holds!

## [CloudZack AI Tools](https://ai.cloudzack.com)
AI Tools is a helpful web application that uses artificial intelligence to assist you with anything language related. It's a simple, minimalistic interface that gives users access to the latest AI Chat technology. 

It can suggest changes or improvements to your text, code, creative, professional, and any other language related task. AI Tools is like having a personal assistant that can provide you with ideas and suggestions as well as help you process chunks of code. Don't worry if you're not very tech savvy, it's really easy to use and will be a great tool for anyone looking to improve their efficiency and effectiveness in language related work or play.

## [StitchJournal](https://stitchjournal.com)
StitchJournal is a web application built on Django and hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk utilizing Django. It is a simple application designed to help crochet pattern designers organize and publish their crochet patterns. I am building this in collaboration with [Yarn and Chai](https://yarnandchai.com)
