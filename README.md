# Current Projects
[CloudZack](https://cloudzack.com) and [StitchJournal](https://stitchjournal.com) are my two main projects currently. I also recently started playing around with OpenAI and am playing around with the capabilities with my project [August](https://github.com/zackrylangford/openai-chatgpt)

## [CloudZack](https://cloudzack.com)
With the goal of empowering users to use cloud technology to its fullest potential, CloudZack was born in 2022. CloudZack has recently lauched the StitchJournal application - an innovative app that makes it easy for users to track their progress on stitching projects. With other innovative products on the horizon, we're excited to see what the future holds!

## [StitchJournal](https://stitchjournal.com)
StitchJournal is a web application built on Django and hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk utilizing Django. It is a simple application designed to help crochet pattern designers organize and publish their crochet patterns. I am building this in collaboration with [Yarn and Chai](https://yarnandchai.com)
